<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Welcome to my portfolio. This is my first organized attempt to start building websites. I was born and raised in Xanthi , Greece and n
  I have moved to Athens with my sweet boyfriend. I work as a product trainer at PeopleCert. I have been working there the last 2 years and 
  got a promotion. I was so happy!!
</p>

<p>I am extremely happy I have started how to code because my goal is to create a website similar to instagram. But I have
  A LONG WAY there. I would like to become a frond end developer. But I will get there , someday....
